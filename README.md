**The Bottom Line**: When the GitHub repositories show that spending 1 hour weekly on structured family storytelling delivers measurable mental health improvements, community resilience building, and cultural preservation‚Äîall backed by peer-reviewed research and real family transformations‚Äîthe movement becomes inevitable. The data makes the case; the stories make it human; the tools make it accessible.
